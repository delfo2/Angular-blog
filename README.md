**Project Overview:**

Black Star News is a dynamic web application built with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) (version 16.2.0) that provides users with access to the latest news headlines from various sources. This project offers a user-friendly interface for viewing news articles and incorporates the Swiper library for an enhanced mobile touch slider experience. Below, you'll find key information about this project.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.


## API Integration
This project utilizes the GNews API to fetch and display news articles. The GNews API provides the latest news headlines from various sources.

For more information about the News API, please visit [GNews API Documentation.](https://gnews.io).

## Swiper Integration

The project now includes Swiper, a free and modern mobile touch slider with hardware accelerated transitions and amazing native behavior. Swiper is intended to be used in mobile websites, mobile web apps, and mobile native/hybrid apps.

Please note that Swiper is not compatible with all platforms; it is a modern touch slider focused only on modern apps/platforms to provide the best experience and simplicity.
